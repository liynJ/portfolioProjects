#### the following repo contains some of my portfolio projects.

## 1. COVID-19 data exploration project
The project is about analyzing the world's Covid-19 situation since the start of the pandemic until the date it was retrieved.(retrieved: 22/06/2021).  
The dashboards shows some of the queries that I've chosen to include in it: 
1. global numbers in terms of death %, #cases, and #deaths.
2. responsive global map of the % of infected population.
3. Death count per continent.
4. average % of population infected in the GCC region (Saudi arabia, UAE, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman, Kuwait) with forecast of future trend in cases.
